## Objective
The objective of this final project is to research and document the functionalities of the OpenAI Playground (https://platform.openai.com/playground/). You will create a comprehensive user manual in either Markdown (.md) or HTML (.html), convert it to a static website using Jekyll, Gatsby, or another static site generator (SSG), and deploy the site using GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## Deliverables
1. **User Manual**: A detailed, well-structured user manual for the OpenAI Playground.
    - Format: Markdown (.md) or HTML (.html)
    - Must include:
        - Introduction to the OpenAI Playground
        - Overview of features and capabilities
        - Step-by-step guide to using key features
        - Tips and best practices for effective usage
        - Example use cases with screenshots or code snippets
        - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section
2. **Static Website**:
    - Converted the manual into a static site using Jekyll, Gatsby, or another SSG of your choice.
    - Include at least:
        - A homepage with a brief introduction and navigation links
        - Dedicated pages for each section of the user manual
    - Use CSS for a clean and readable design.
3. **Deployed Website**:
    - The final static site deployed using either GitHub Pages or Netlify.
    - Ensure the site is publicly accessible.

## Requirements
### Content
- **Introduction**: Describe the OpenAI Playground, including its purpose and importance.
- **Features**: Provide detailed explanations of its major features (e.g., model selection, input/output configuration, API exploration).
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step guides with screenshots or visuals.
- **Examples**: Include sample prompts and responses.
- **Design**: Ensure clarity, consistency, and accessibility.

### Technical
1. **File Structure**:
    - Organize your project files in a clean structure, following the conventions of your chosen SSG.
    - Example (Jekyll):
      ```
      .
      ├── _config.yml
      ├── _posts/
      ├── _layouts/
      ├── index.md
      ├── assets/
      └── _site/
      ```
    - Example (Gatsby):
      ```
      .
      ├── src/
      ├── gatsby-config.js
      ├── static/
      ├── content/
      └── public/
      ```
2. **Version Control**:
    - Use Git for version control.
    - Push your code to a GitHub repository.
3. **Deployment**:
    - Deploy using GitHub Pages or Netlify.
    - Include deployment instructions in your repository’s README.md.

## Milestones
1. **Week 1: Research**
    - Explore the OpenAI Playground and document its features.
    - Draft the outline of your user manual.
2. **Week 2: Draft Manual**
    - Create the first draft of the manual in Markdown or HTML.
    - Review and refine the content.
3. **Week 3: Convert to Static Site**
    - Set up Jekyll, Gatsby, or another SSG.
    - Convert the manual into a structured static site.
4. **Week 4: Deploy and Submit**
    - Deploy your site using GitHub Pages or Netlify.
    - Submit the GitHub repository link and the deployed site link.

## Submission Guidelines
1. **GitHub Repository**:
    - Your repository should include:
        - Source files (.md or .html, along with any CSS/JS files).
        - Static site files generated by the SSG.
        - README.md with clear instructions on how to run and deploy the site.
2. **Deployed Website**:
    - Submit the live link to your deployed website.
3. **Final Submission**:
    - Submit your GitHub repository and deployed site links via [submission method, e.g., LMS or email].
